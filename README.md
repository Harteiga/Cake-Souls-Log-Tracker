# Cake-Souls-Log-Tracker
This program is designed to check logs for cake soul drops and the amount of cakes eaten

The Cake Soul log searching tool is known to work with both the Vanilla and Badlion Client on Windows and Mac OS.
If it does not work with a client you use, feel free to message the creator, Harteiga, on a platform such as Discord @ Lo/Hart#0940.

It is worth noting that this only checks logs on the current computer so searching logs won't account for cakes eaten on other devices.

To use this:
1. Open the .py file if you have the appropriate tool or the .exe file if you don't (Less Transparency)
2. Select your current logs folder
3. Hit the button to check the selected folder
4. Wait for results. This may take some time on slower computers or with players with many logs.
