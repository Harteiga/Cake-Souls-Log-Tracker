# Cake-Souls-Log-Tracker
This program is designed to check logs for cake soul drops and the amount of cakes eaten

The Cake Soul log searching tool is known to work with both the Vanilla and Badlion Client. 
If it does not work with a client you use, feel free to message the creator, Harteiga, on a platform such as Discord @ Lo/Hart#0940.

It is worth noting that this only checks logs on the current computer so searching logs won't account for cakes eaten on other devices.

To use this:
1. Select your current logs folder
2. Hit the button to check the selected folder
3. Wait for results. This may take some time on slower computers or with players with many logs.

The .py file is recommended for users with the appropriate software as it provides transparency but the .exe file is there for any user not able to do so.
